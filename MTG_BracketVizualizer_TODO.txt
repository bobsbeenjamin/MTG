/*** TODO List for MTG Bracket Visualizer project at https://github.com/bobsbeenjamin/MTG/ ***/

Time: 12 hrs

TODOs:
	Visualization
		Show chunks of cards per level
			4, 8, 16
		Show very large numbers of cards per level: 256+
		Order left-to-right
		Order top-to-bottom
		Let user set zoom factor (slider or +/- buttons)
		Experiment with text
			Try text only w/ image on hover
			When should name display under/over card? (My guess is chunks of 4 and 8)
	Navigation
		Move up and down levels
	Data
		Pull smaller chunks of data
		Store and retreive data within the browser
	Images
		Handle special characters (",", "'", etc)
		Switch to magiccards.info?
		
Done:

/*** TODO List for MTG Sealed Deck Generator Project at https://github.com/bobsbeenjamin/MTG/ ***/

Time: 120 hrs
Note: The seed of this project was my initial attempt at implementing Magic in a browser.

TODOs: 
	Set info
		Add Amonkhet
			Eventually, let the user select their format
		Fix split cards
			How to handle dups? (Mana cost, CMC, type, rules text)
			Fix Promo stamp (unreadable on white and half-white cards)
	User-defined sorting and grouping
		Should each dropdown give sort and group options?
		Link options (make selection from sort 1 modify options for sort 2, etc)
		Break up large groups?
		Add new groupings:
			[creature, non-creature]
			[ground creature, evasive threat, removal, combat trick, card draw, mana accel, other non-land, land]
		Fix bugs of displaying group title
			Title text is too small
	2HG
		Add support for 2HG
	Deckbuilding stats
		Display updated stats live
		Card count, Mana curve, Color info
	Additional card info
		Display below cardZoom
	Mobile support
		Card popup on long press
		Adapt card size and canvas size for card pool and deck
	Hand similator
		Add a battlefield canvas, and let the user "play" cards to the battlefield
		Hide cardpool when the hand and battlefield are displayed
		Add scry button
		
Done: 
	Additional card info
		Store additional card info
		Get and store color
	Set info
		Automate the creation of card sets (implemented using gatherer searches and Python)
		Scrape and store rich card info

		Fix split cards
			Names need special handling
			Eliminate dups
		Eliminate dups that happen when cards are reprinted in a new set with a different rarity

	User-defined sorting and grouping
		Allow user-defined sorting
		Fix alphabetical sort (only works with 2 sort options)
		Add support for groupings
		Impliment groupings for card type
		Display group info (card type, CMC, etc) above each group
		Apply grouping functionality to deck (currently only works for cardpool)
		Fix display/click issue: because cards are displayed asynchronously, cards don't overlap properly
		Fix display issue for groupings: Cards are not showing that they were added or removed from a group
		Fix bugs of displaying group title
			Long dash (â€”) shows as somthing else (probably a UTF-8 issue)
			Promo and Mythic are lumped together
			Long Card Type names run out of room
			Color shows as color code (W for White, etc)
	Hand similator
		Add basic lands
		Draw opening hands
		Don't keep cards in hand when modifying deck
		Display cardpool correctly after viewing hand
		Add mulligan button
		Add "Draw New Hand" button
	Misc
		Why does page sometime give "Wait" prompt? (This went away by itself)

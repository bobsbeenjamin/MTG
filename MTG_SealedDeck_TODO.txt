/*** TODO List for MTG Sealed Deck Generator Project at https://github.com/bobsbeenjamin/MTG/ ***/

Time: 90 hrs
Note: The seed of this project was my initial attempt at implementing Magic in a browser.

TODOs: 
	Set info
		Add Amonkhet
			Start with giving user an Amonkhet pool
			Eventually, let the user select their format
		Fix split cards
			How to handle dups? (Mana cost, CMC, type, rules text)
	User-defined sorting and grouping
		Should each dropdown give sort and group options?
		Link options (make selection from sort 1 modify options for sort 2, etc)
		Break up large groups?
		Fix bugs of displaying group info
			Long dash (â€”) shows as somthing else (probably a UTF-8 issue)
			Promo and Mythic are lumped together
			Long Card Type names run out of room
			Color shows as color code (W for White, etc)
			Title text is too small

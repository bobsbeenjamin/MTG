/*** TODO List for MTG Sealed Deck Generator Project at https://github.com/bobsbeenjamin/MTG/ ***/

Time: 90 hrs
Note: The seed of this project was my initial attempt at implementing Magic in a browser.

TODOs: 
	Allow user-defined sorting
		Add groupings
		Should each dropdown give sort and group options?
		Link options (make selection from sort 1 modify options for sort 2, etc)
	Support 2HG
	Deckbuilding stats
		Display updated stats live
		Card count, Mana curve, Color info
	Store additional card info
		Display below cardZoom
	Mobile support
		Card popup on long press
		Adapt card size and canvas size for card pool and deck
		
Done: 
	Store additional card info
		Get color
	Allow user-defined sorting
		Fix alphabetical sort (only works with 2 sort options)
	Hand similator
		Add basic lands
		Draw opening hands
		Don't keep cards in hand when modifying deck
		Display cardpool correctly after viewing hand
		Add mulligan button
		Add "Draw New Hand" button
	Why does page sometime give "Wait" prompt? (This went away by itself)
	Change verbiage from draft to sealed

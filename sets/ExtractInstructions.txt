When a new set is available in gatherer, this process will convert some gatherer searches into a JavaScript file that is usable by the MTG Sealed Deck project.
	Step 1: Create your work space (this step may not be needed if the work space was created for an earlier set in the block):
		1a: Create a new folder to use as your work space 
		1b: Copy the "ExtractSetInfo_Rich.py" script into the work space
	Step 2: Run and convert a separate gatherer search for each rarity:
		2a: In Chrome, go to the following URL, except replace the set name appropriately: http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?sort=cn+&action=advanced&set=["Amonkhet"]
		2b: Press Ctrl+Shift+j to open the console
		2c: Go to the Sources tab
		2d: On the left hand nav, click the "Default.aspx" file to select it
		2e: Right-click the file, and select "Save as..."
		2f: Save the file to your work space with the name "cardSearchResults[N].html", where [N] is the page number of the search results
		2j: Repeat step 2 for each page in the search results
    NOTE1: Sets with double-face cards will have each face get a result in the gatherer search. Eventually, I will handle this in the script, but for now, just delete the back face of those cards.
    NOTE2: If a card has 2 versions (such as the Guildgates in GRN), then my parsing logic leave's some wierd stuff in the name. You will need to delete that stuff, because one of the characters is a quote.
	Step 3: Wrap up
		3a: Run the extract script
		3b: Rename the html files by appending "_[SetName]" to the end
		3c: Open the output file in a text editor, and delete the card objects for the cards that are specific to Planeswalker decks and box promo (special cards). You can usually tell where the divide is, because the color order starts over for each rarity. Also, the search string in 2a should sort all special cards to the end, since they have collector numbers higher than the set total. Unfortunately, the collector number doesn't seem to be scrapable from the page.

When a new set is available in gatherer, this process will convert some gatherer searches into a JavaScript file that is usable by the MTG Sealed Deck project.
	Step 1: Create your work space (this step may not be needed if the work space was created for an earlier set in the block):
		1a: Create a new folder to use as your work space 
		1b: Copy the "ExtractSetInfo_Rich.py" script into the work space
	Step 2: Run and convert a separate gatherer search for each rarity:
		2a: In Chrome, go to the following URL, except replace the set name and rarity appropriately: http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?sort=cn+&action=advanced&set=["Amonkhet"]&rarity=[R]
		2b: Press Ctrl+Shift+j to open the console
		2c: Go to the Sources tab
		2d: On the left hand nav, click the "Default.aspx" file to select it
		2e: Right-click the file, and select "Save as..."
		2f: Save the file to your work space with the name "cardSearchResults.html"
		2g: Run the extract script and select the appropriate rarity
		2h: Rename the html file by appending "_[SetName]_[Rarity]" to the end
		2i: Open the output file in a text editor, and delete the card objects for the cards that are specific to Planeswalker decks (you can usually easily tell where the divide is, because the color order starts over for non-commons, and basic lands show up for commons)
		2j: Repeat step 2 for each other rarity
		NOTE1: Large sets will often have 2 web pages of results for commons. When that happens, run step 2 one last time, except: in step 2a, click the next page button instead of running a fresh search; and in step 2g, type "C2" on the command line (a special file name will be given to the output file).
    NOTE2: Sets with double-face cards will have each face get a result in the gatherer search. Eventually, I will handle this in the script, but for now, just delete the back face of those cards.
    NOTE3: If a card has 2 versions (such as the Guildgates in GRN), then my parsing logic leave's some wierd stuff in the name. You will need to delete that stuff, because one of the characters is a quote.
	Step 3: Wrap up
		3a: When you run the extract script for the last rarity, the rarity files will all be combined into a set file. When this happens, if duplicate card entries are detected, then you will be prompted to select the appropriate rarity, and the script will delete the other card(s).
		3b: Once this process is done, repeat step 2i for the generated set file
		NOTE: If there are 2 common files to process, then the combined set file will be created twice. That's no big deal.
